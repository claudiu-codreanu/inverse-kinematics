# Inverse Kinematics

[Simulates a multi-segment robotic arm/tentacle](https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/inverse-kinematics/main.html), using the inverse kinematics technique.  
The arm follows a ball that bounces around using random speeds on X and Y axis.

First off, I greatly enjoy the variety of these challenges, and the stories behind them.  
This week was no exception â€“ it was fun learning about inverse kinematics, and code-playing with it.


Iâ€™ll be honest, without the provided instructions, I would have no idea how to simulate a jointed arm.  
All I did was to follow them, and to add a personal touch in a few places:


- I painted the joints between arm segments
- Instead of mouse-cursor, my arm follows a ball that bounces around at random X/Y speeds
- I used classes for the arm, segments, and ballâ€¦ because it feels easier for me than pure functional programming

Thatâ€™s it, not much to brag aboutâ€¦  
But I stil hope youâ€™ll enjoy my pen.

By the way, Iâ€™ve showed it to my younger son, and he loved it!
He plans to take computer science next year (11th grade), so the timing couldnâ€™t be better ðŸ˜Ž

Robotic arms/tentacles are cool!
